Brewnit
=======

#### *Bringing open-source to brewing*

Brewnit is a software to help you plan your brewing recipes.

It will compute a few things for you. Things like :

 * The estimated original gravity of your beer
 * The estimated final gravity
 * Estimated ABV
 * The water needed for each step of the brewing process
 * Estimated colour of your beer

The software comes with a small language to describe the components involved in the creation of your recipe.

The grammar is available and compilable using [nitcc](https://github.com/privat/nit/tree/master/contrib/nitcc).

The software itself is compilable using the Nit language's compiler, also available [here](https://github.com/privat/nit)
